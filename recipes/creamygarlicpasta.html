<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>300g tagliatelle</li>
    <li> 6 garlic gloves, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tsp plain flour</li>
    <li>150ml of chicken stock</li>
    <li>200ml double cream</li>

</div>
<div class= "steps">
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Begin by cooking the pasta following pack instructions. Meanwhile, melt the butter in your largest frying pan. Once foaming, add the garlic and 25 twists of a black pepper mill. Cook for 4-5 mins, until the garlic is light golden and fragrant.</li>
    <li>Stir in the flour to form a paste. Stir for 1-2 mins, then slowly whisk in the chicken stock until you have a smooth sauce. Pour in the double cream and sprinkle in most of the parmesan. Stir until everything is melted and combined, then season to taste.</li>
    <li>Transfer the pasta straight into the sauce, alongside a good splash of the cooking water. Mix thoroughly, adding a little more pasta water if necessary, until you have a thick and glossy sauce.</li>
    <li>Divide between four bowls and serve topped with the chopped parsley and remaining parmesan.</li>
</ol>
